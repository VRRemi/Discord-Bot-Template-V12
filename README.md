`Setup Process`

* Rename `example.env`to `.env`
* Add your Discord Bot Token(discord.com/developers), and change prefix to your liking.
* Download the Modules by typing `npm i` in the Terminal/Console.
* Start the bot by typing `node .`

`Included Commands in the Template`

* `s!help` (Shows the bots list of commands)
* `s!ping` (Displays the bot's current ping, uptime, & memory usage)

`Notes`

* Adding new commands is pretty simple, just add a `filename.js`and copy the template of other commands.
* I recommend reading a bit of the documentation on https://discord.js.org to get a bit more understanding of the variables.
